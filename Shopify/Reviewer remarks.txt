Hello.

My name is Yulia and I will be reviewing your project.

Thanks for sending it for review. Let's look at screen shots and see whether any changes are needed.

Task 1.1. KPI card

The card and the calculation are correct. 

Task 1.2. Line Chart

The chart is correct. 

Task 1.3. Scatterplot

You built the scatterplot correctly. 

From the chart we can also say that the apps with over 5K of reviews are rare, as well as the apps with average rating of less than 4. And there is a weak positive correlation between the number of reviews and the average rating - i.e. the more reviews the app has, the higher its rating.

Task 2.1. KPI card

Well done - you’ve added the new column with the calculation in line with the task. 

Task 2.2. Scatterplot

Well done.

Task 3.1.-3.3 Barcharts

You made good charts and added the correct filter. Just do not forget that sometimes it’s worth changing the automatically assigned chart titles and axes names to make the charts easier for understanding.

The overall conclusion: you’ve done an excellent job. There are no critical comments, your project is complete.

Good luck to you with the next projects.
