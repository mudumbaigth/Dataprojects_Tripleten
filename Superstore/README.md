This was the fifth project that I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned for Tableau Story Telling. The purpose was to prepare an analysis for the CEO of Superstore to help them understand what is causing customers to return their orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders.

## Data

The data was one Google spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:
'Superstore.xls': each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd'
- 'orders': details all fields for each ordered item
- 'returns': details all fields for each returned item

## Description

- 7-Page Tableau Visualization and Presentation
- Includes data analysis charts dashboard and stories

## Assumptions

1. Profits from sales are totaling in the negative.
2. There is one or more causes for negative profits directly related to orders and returns.
3. The operations department will need to make changes.
4. The advertising department needs recommendations.

## Process

I first joined the sheets. Then I determined profit and loss centers. Lastly I examined the contribution returns had on profits.

## Recommendations

1. Among the pair of dimension of sub-category and region the copiers sub-category with $20160 profit in the west region is the maximum profit maker followed by copiers in the central region with $8400 profit.

   Among the pair of dimension of sub-category and region the binders sub-category with $27429 loss in the central region is the maximum loss maker followed by machines in the east region with $9240 loss.
2. The superstore should stop selling GBC DocuBind P400 Electric Binding System with a loss of $25369.
3. The 3 major sub-categories the store should focus on are copiers phones and accessories and they should stop selling tables bookcases and supplies.
