### Data
TripleTen provided an archived file of 5 separate Excel files from the mock company Zomato. I used 3 for this project.
- `'Zomato data.zip'`: Compressed Excel files provided by team lead
    - `'orders'`: All orders made from the menu by all customers at all restaurants between Oct. 4th 2017 and June 26th 2020.
    - `'users'`: All customers who completed orders during the designated time frame and their demographic information.
- `Restaurant Table`: Housing all Restaurant related details.

### Description
Zomato is a multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. 
Provides food delivery services across multiple countries/cities partnering with multiple restaurants 
Received information on Food menu Restaurants partnered Orders placed along with user-reviews/patterns in select cities from 2017-2020. 
To achieve better profitability & Choose the right restaurant partners Zomato can benefit from various types of business/data analysis that provide insights into different aspects of its business. 
Need is to generate data analysis based on Orders/Customers(user)/Restaurant and generate key reports to help Zomato improve its profitability and do better in business

### Assumptions
- The provided test datasets are accurate complete and consistent.
- Missing values or inconsistencies are minimal and will not significantly impact the analysis.
- The column descriptions accurately reflect the content of each table.
- The provided tables (orders and users) contain all the necessary information for the chosen analysis.
- Zomato's business context and industry trends are considered while interpreting the data.

### Process
I first learned of the problem presented in its entirety and its requirements for approval.
Then I chose software and created my first submission the "Decomposition Plan".
After I analyzed the data and created visualizations and dashboards for a second submission.
Lastly I presented my findings in a report as my 3rd and final submission piece.

### Findings
Based on the insights derived from the Zomato Restaurant Analysis Dashboard here are several recommendations to improve restaurant performance and enhance customer experience:
- **Enhance Marketing for High-Performing Restaurants**:
  - **Rationale**: Domino’s Pizza, Pizza Hut, and KFC show strong performance in terms of order volume, revenue, and customer ratings.
  - **Action**: Invest in targeted marketing campaigns for these high-performing restaurants to further boost their visibility and sales. Highlight positive customer reviews and ratings in marketing materials to attract new customers.
- **Improve Customer Loyalty Programs**:
  - **Rationale**: Repeat orders are significant for Domino’s Pizza, Pizza Hut, and KFC, indicating customer loyalty.
  - **Action**: Strengthen loyalty programs by offering rewards, discounts, and exclusive deals for repeat customers. Encourage other restaurants to adopt similar loyalty programs to increase repeat orders and customer retention.
- **Focus on Underperforming Restaurants**:
  - **Rationale**: Some restaurants have lower order volumes, revenues, and customer ratings.
  - **Action**: Identify and address the specific issues faced by these underperforming restaurants. This could include menu improvements, better pricing strategies, staff training, or enhanced customer service. Use customer feedback to pinpoint areas for improvement.
- **Leverage High Average Order Value**:
  - **Rationale**: Domino’s Pizza has the highest average order value, indicating customers are willing to spend more.
  - **Action**: Analyze the factors contributing to the high average order value at Domino’s Pizza and implement similar strategies across other restaurants. This might include bundling products, offering premium items, or creating value meals.
- **Increase Positive Customer Reviews**:
  - **Rationale**: Positive reviews significantly impact customer perception and attract new customers.
  - **Action**: Encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews by simplifying the review process and offering small incentives. Address negative reviews promptly and constructively to improve overall ratings.

Implementing these recommendations can help Zomato leverage its strengths, address its weaknesses, and provide an enhanced dining experience for its customers, ultimately driving growth and customer satisfaction.
